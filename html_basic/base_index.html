  <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <!-- Paragraphs -->
  <p>This is my very first webpage created as part of my learning journey with ALX. Iâ€™m excited to start building more complex and creative web projects.</p>
  <p>Here, you will find different sections that showcase my progress, including projects, blogs, and more in the future.</p>
  <p>I have included headings, paragraphs, and even a clickable image that links to an external site. This helps demonstrate the use of various HTML tags.</p>
  <p>Every big journey starts with a small step, and this webpage is my first step into the world of web development!</p>
